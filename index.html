            <h2>About me</h2>
            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>
              In September 2025, I began my PhD at the <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/">University of Birmingham</a> where I am working on <a href="projects/ABORAS/ABORAS.html">ABORAS</a> (A dual-Beam pOlarimetric Robotic Aperture for the Sun).
              This will serve as a dedicated Solar input for the HARPS3 instrument which will be installed on the <a href="https://www.ing.iac.es/Astronomy/telescopes/int/">2.5-m Isaac Newton Telescope</a> in La Palma.
              ABORAS will help to improve our understanding of stellar variability, track the long-term stability of HARPS3, and serve as a benchmark for the detection of Earth-sized exoplanets around sunlike stars.

            <p>
              I graduated from the <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/">University of Sheffield</a> with a Master's degree in Physics and Astronomy in July 2024. 
              In 2023, I worked as a support astronomer at the <a href="https://www.ing.iac.es/">Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes (ING)</a> in La Palma.
              From 2024 - 25 I worked as a planetarium presenter for <a href="https://www.immersive-experiences.co.uk/">Immersive Experiences</a>, where I travelled across the UK delivering a variety of presentations to a diverse range of audiences.

            <h3>Undergraduate work</h3>
            <p>
              In my third and fourth years, my researched focused mainly on a type of interacting binary star called cataclysmic variables (CVs). 
              My third year research involved taking photometric observations of the CV V1315 Aquilae with the 0.5-m <i>pt5m</i> telescope in La Palma. 
              The lightcurve of V1315 Aquilae was analysed to determine the inclination and radius of the accretion disc which surrounds the primary white dwarf star.
              I also worked on a detector aimed at measuring miniscule tremors with frequencies associated with Parkinson's disease.
            </p>

            <p>
              After the third year, I spent a year working as a support astronomer for the ING at the Observatorio de Roque de los Muchachos in La Palma. 
              In this role, I was responsible for training visiting observers to use the 2.5-m Isaac Newton Telescope, as well as performing service observations and setting up its two instruments.
              Towards the end of my time at the ING I performed my own observations with the Isaac Newton Telescope, which I worked on in my fourth year for my <a href="projects/masters/research-proj.html">masters project</a>.
            </p>

            <img src="projects/access-park.jpg" style="width: 90%; border-radius: 10px;" class="center" />

            <p>
              My fourth year research project involved using spectroscopic data of a CV to determine the masses of its component stars. 
              These mass measurements were then used to test the predictions of the standard evolutionary model of CVs.
