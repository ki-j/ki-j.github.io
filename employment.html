              <p style="width: 70%;">
                This placement at the <a href="https://www.ing.iac.es/">ING</a> involved working as a support astronomer on the 2.5-m Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) in La Palma.
                The main responsibility of support astronomers is to ensure the smooth and efficient running of the telescope, and to obtain the best data possible.<br>
                <br>
                Support astronomers provide support to visiting astronomers by training them to use the telescope safely and effectively and providing any additional support.
                Service observations are also performed by support astronomers for observers unable to personally visit the telescope.<br>
                <br>
                Additional roles include the setting up and calibration of the telescope's two instruments - the Wide Field Camera (WFC) and Intermediate Dispersion Spectrograph (IDS).
                More about the support astronomer role can be found <a href="cvs/placement_year/INT.html">here</a>.
