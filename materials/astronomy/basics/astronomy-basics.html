              <p><b>
                Astronomy is an interesting science for many reasons. 
                One of these is that, on the whole, it is impossible to create scientific experiments to understand astronomical objects and phenomena.
                Even the closest objects to us - such as the Sun, planets, asteroids, and comets - are today mostly unreachable.
                Scientists have learned a lot from the "space stuff" which we can touch, such as meteorites which fell to Earth, Moon rocks collected from the Apollo missions, and Mars soil collected from highly advanced rovers.
                However, what we can learn of the Universe from these samples of Solar System objects is limited.
                Astronomers primarily study the light from distant objects in order to understand the stars, galaxies, nebulae, and other phenomena which populate the Universe.

              <!-- what is light -->
              <h4 id="what-is-light">What is light?</h4> <!-- WHAT IS LIGHT? -->
              <p>
                Light behaves both as a wave and a particle.
                This is known as <span class="important">wave-particle duality</span>. 
                Here, we will investigate the nature of light and demonstrate both its wave-like and particle-like behaviour.

                <!-- light as a wave -->
                <h4 id="light-as-a-wave">Light as a wave</h4> <!-- lIGHT AS A WAVE -->
                <p>
                  It is relatively straightforward to demonstrate how light acts as a wave. 
                  Light gets reflected, refracted, and diffracted - the latter of which is used in <span class="important">Young's double slit experiment</span>.
                  In this experiment, light is passed through two thin parallel slits and forms a diffraction pattern.
                  Consider light from a light source which passes through two thin slits as shown in Figure 1.
                  Each slit will act as an individual light source.
                  As the light from each slit diffracts, it will overlap and <span class="important">interfere</span>. 
                  This interference will create a diffraction pattern.
                </p>

              <p>
                The particle behaviour of light can be demonstrated with the <span class="important">photoelectric effect</span>. 
                Light can be used to excite electrons in metals, giving them enough energy to escape.
                Thinking logically, it is easy to assume then that by increasing the intensity of light, more electrons will escape.
                However, this is not what happens in the metal sheet.
                Instead, it is the <span class="important">frequency</span> of light which affects the number of escaped electrons.
                Below a certain frequency, there will be no escaped electrons at all - no matter the intensity of light used.
              </p>

              <h4 style="color: #304590;" id="the-photoelectric-effect">The photoelectric effect</h4> <!-- THE PHOTOELECTRIC EFFECT -->
              <p>
                Figure 3 shows the photoelectric effect.
                When blue or ultraviolet (UV) light is shone onto a metal sheet, the electrons in the metal absorb the energy from the light.
                Electrons have certain levels of energy in which they reside.
                When an electron gains energy, it becomes <span class="important">excited</span> moves to a higher energy level.
                If an electron gains enough energy, it can also escape the atom to which it is bonded.
                The energy from light absorbed by electrons is proportional to the frequency of that light.
                It is given by the formula:<br><br>
                <span class="equation center">E = hf</span><br>
                where <b><i>E</i></b> is the energy, <b><i>f</i></b> is the frequency of the light, and <b><i>h</i></b> is Planck's constant.
              </p>

                  <b>Figure 3:</b>
                  Left: Electrons absorb high frequency light and gain enough energy to escape the metal sheet.
                  Right: The low frequency light does not carry enough energy for the electrons to escape.
                </figcaption>
              </figure>

              <p>
                So how does the photoelectric effect demonstrate the particle nature of light?
                In 1905, Einsten predicted this dependence on frequency, with the formula <i>E = hf</i> shown above.
                This formula refers to the energy of a particle of light called a <span class="important">photon</span>. 
                Each electron in the sheet of metal requires a certain amount of energy to escape, which is proportional to the frequency of a photon of light.
                In the photoelectric effect, the electron must absorb a photon with a certain frequency in order to escape.
                The amount of energy required to escape is called the work function, <b><i>W</i></b>. 
                So, the energy of an electron which has been freed is the difference between the photon energy and the work function:<br><br>
                <span class="equation center">E<sub>FE</sub> = hf - W</span><br>
                If the frequency is less than the work function, the electron cannot escape.
                Einstein showed that photons have an energy dependent on frequency, and that also photons have momentum:<br><br>
                <div class="equation center">
                  p =

              </p>
              <p>
                which can be shown through the study of special relativity.
              </p>

              <div class="astroSectionDetail center">
                <h4 id="wave-particle-duality">Wave-particle duality</h4> <!-- WAVE-PARTICLE DUALITY -->
                <p>
                  We have demonstrated that light behaves as a wave in <span class="important">Young's double slit experiment</span>, and as a particle in the <span class="important">photoelectric effect</span>. 
                  There are also experiments which can show both.
                  Imagine we carry out Young's double slit experiment again, but this time lower the intensity of the light source enough that only one photon is emitted at a time. 
                  Here, as the individual photons pass through the slits one might expect two piles of photons on the screen where they each are landing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  What we actually see is rather different.
                  As photons are passed one-by-one through the slits, they initially seem to take up a random position on the screen (Figure 4 | Left).
                  As more and more are added, it is noticable that the pattern which forms is actually the same diffraction pattern we would expect to see in the original double slit experiment (Figure 4 | Right).
                  So what is going on?
                  The photons are actually <span class="important">interfering with themselves</span>!
                  Light is not a wave or a particle, but behaves like both at the same time. 
                  Its true nature requires the study of quantum mechanics.
                  It is easier to treat light either like a wave or a particle, depending on what we need it for.

                Waves in the ocean or ripples through ponds propagate through water.
                Sound waves propagate through air.
                So what does light move in?
                Light is an electromagnetic wave (Figure 5).
                It is made up of an electric wave and a magnetic wave which oscillate in phase, but perpendicular to each other.
                The direction of propagation (the direction the light wave travels) is perpendicular to both the electric and magnetic waves.
                The propagation speed is given by the equation:<br><br>

                  Light is grouped into different types of radiation, which are shown in Figure 6.
                  Visible light, the light we see, is a small part of this spectrum.
                  In astronomy, different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum are useful for studying different objects.
                  For example, UV emission comes from high-energy objects such as young new stars.
                  However, our atmosphere absorbs this part of the spectrum, so space telescopes such as the JWST are required.

                The most basic thing you can measure in astronomy is how much light something is emitting.
                The <span class="important">monochromatic flux</span> is defined as the amount of energy <b><i>&Delta;E</i></b> incident on a unit area <b><i>&Delta;A</i></b>, per unit time <b><i>&Delta;t</i></b>, for a given infinitely small frequency range.
                This frequency range <b><i>&delta;&nu;</i></b> is the closest we can get to a single frequency, in the same way a single point has no area for light to hit.
                The monochromatic flux is given by the equation:<br><br>
                <div class="equation center">
                  F<sub>&nu;</sub> = 
                  <div class="frac">
                    <span>&Delta;E</span> <!-- numerator -->
                    <span class="symbol">/</span>
                    <span class="bottom">&Delta;&nu; &Delta;t &Delta;A</span> <!-- denominator -->

                </div>
              </p>
              <p>
                where <b><i>&delta;&nu;</i></b>, <b><i>&delta;A</i></b>, and <b><i>&delta;t</i></b> tend to 0.
                The amount of light across all wavelengths, the <span class="important">bolometric flux</span> is given by the sum of all monochromatic fluxes:
                <div class="equation center">
                  F<sub>bol</sub> = &int;
                  <div class="frac">

                  </div>
                  F<sub>&nu;</sub> &delta;&nu;
                </div>
              </p>

                <p>
                  Wavelength and frequency are linked, as they are two ways of measuring the same property of a wave.
                  For a given frequency range <b><i>&Delta;&nu;</i></b>, there is a corresponding wavelength range <b><i>&Delta;&lambda;</i></b>. 
                  The monochromatic flux can therefore be written in terms of wavelength:
                  <div class="equation center">
                    F<sub>&nu;</sub> &delta;&nu; = F<sub>&lambda;</sub> &delta;&lambda;
                  </div>
                </p>
                <p>
                  By rearranging this and using the <span class="important">wave equation</span>, we get an equation linking <b><i>&Delta;&nu;</i></b> and <b><i>&Delta;&lambda;</i></b>:
                  <div class="equation center">
                    F<sub>&nu;</sub> = F<sub>&lambda;</sub>

                  Flux is what we measure from Earth.
                  However, it does not tell us a lot about the properties of the star itself.
                  There are around 5000 stars visible to the naked eye in the night sky.
                  None of these look as bright to us as Venus, the second planet from the Sun.
                  The <span class="important">luminosity</span> of an object is a fundamental property and it is the total amount of energy emitted in all directions. 
                  Monochromatic luminosity is the luminosity of a source per unit time, per unit frequency.
                  Bolometric luminosity is the sum of all monochromatic frequencies.

                <p>
                  How are luminosity and flux related?
                  We know that we only see the tiniest fraction of a star's light in the sky.
                  The amount light diminishes is given by the inverse-square law.
                  Imagine you are a distance <b><i>d</i></b> from a source such as a star.
                  A sphere with radius <b><i>d</i></b> (see Figure 7) will have a total flux incident upon it equivalent to the luminosity of the source. 
                  In other words, the total light from the source is spread out over the surface area of the sphere.
                </p>

                  Thus, the flux is related to the luminosity by the equation:

              <p>
                <b>
                  Magnitudes are used in astronomy to describe the brightness of an object. 
                  The system used is not entirely intuitive and results from the continuation of previous terminology and notation.
                  Famously, the Greeks loved to split things into sixes - their 360&deg; circles are still used today.
                  They also split stars into sixes, ranking them from magnitudes 1 to 6, with 1 being the brightest.
                  Today, we have adapted this system with what we now know about light and brightness.
                  This is relatively common in astronomy, another example being the classification of stars (OBAFGKM - O being the hottest and brightest, our Sun is a G dwarf).
                  In this section we discuss the magnitude system, how to interperate magnitudes and how to calculate luminosities with them.
                </b>
              </p>

              <!-- what are magnitudes -->
              <h4 id="what-are-magnitudes">What are magnitudes?</h4>
              <p>
                Magnitudes are the result of astronomy's clingy nature. 
                Measuring the flux of an object allows you to calculate its luminosity, as long as you know the distance to it.
                Yet, magnitudes have simply stuck around as the astronomers right-hand-mag, the benefit being that it is generally easier to work with smaller numbers.
              </p>

              <p>
                The magnitude equivalent of flux is <span class="important">apparent magnitude</span> - the magnitude that a source appears to us from Earth.
                This is the scale the Ancient Greeks used to rank the stars from magnitude 1 through 6, the brightest being m=1.
                Back then, each magnitude was twice as bright as the previous - a <span class="important">logarithmic scale</span>.
                It still is a logarithmic scale but not quite the same relation.
                Apparent magnitude is related to monochromatic flux by:
                <div class="equation center">
                  m<sub>&nu;</sub> = -2.5 log<sub>10</sub>(F<sub>&nu;</sub>) + c
                </div>
              </p>
              <p>
                Brighter stars still have smaller magnitudes in the modern definition.
                The value of <b><i>c</i></b> can be any number, as long as it is constant between measurements.
              </p>

              <!-- photometry -->
              <h4 id="photometry">Photometry</h4>
              <p>
                Photometry is the measure of an objects brightness (literally the measuring of light).
                Monochromatic fluxes are measured with telescopes by using <span class="important">filters</span> to isolate specific wavelength ranges.
                A commonly used filter set is the <i>Johnsons-Cousins</i> set, which contains the filters:
                <ul style="list-style-type: none; width: 120px; font-weight: bold;" class="center">
                  <li style="background-color: violet; padding: 3px 3px; border-radius: 4px;">U - Ultraviolet</li>
                  <li style="background-color: blue; padding: 3px 3px; border-radius: 4px;">B - Blue</li>
                  <li style="background-color: green; padding: 3px 3px; border-radius: 4px;">V - Visual</li>
                  <li style="background-color: red; padding: 3px 3px; border-radius: 4px;">R - Red</li>
                  <li style="background-color: darkred; padding: 3px 3px; border-radius: 4px;">I - Infared</li>
                </ul>
              </p>
              <p>
                Each filter has a central wavelength <b><i>&lambda;<sub>c</sub></i></b> and wavelength range (width) <b><i>&Delta;&lambda;</i></b>.
                This central wavelength is where transmission is greatest (see Figure 1).
                The width shows the wavelengths which are also detected with the filter.
                Figure 1 shows the transmission of the Johnsons-Cousins filter set.

                <p>
                  In practise, filters are placed on cameras on telescopes with some collection area <b><i>&Delta;A</i></b> and exposed to light for time <b><i>&Delta;t</i></b>.
                  The detector detects a certain fraction of the photons which hit it, known as the efficiency <b><i>&eta;</i></b>. 
                  The <span class="important">total number of photons</span> which fell on the detector <b><i>N</i></b> is therefore N / &eta;. 
                  The <span class="important">energy</span> of each photon is given by E = hf = hc/&lambda; (on average).
                  So the total energy is:
                  <div class="equation center">
                    &Delta;E = 
                    <div class="frac">

                      <span class="symbol">/</span>
                      <span class="bottom">&eta;&lambda;</span> <!-- denominator -->
                    </div>
                  </div>
                </p>
                <p>
                  where the flux can be calculated from &Delta;E.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The calculated flux is normally named after the filter that was used (e.g. F<sub>V</sub> for the Johnson V filter.)
                  The apparent magnitude is then calculated as before:
                  <div class="equation center">
                    m<sub>V</sub> = -2.5 log<sub>10</sub>F<sub>V</sub> + c<sub>V</sub>
                  </div>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Here the constant c is diferent in each filter.
                  It is chosen so that the <span class="important">magnitude of the star Vega has a magnitude of 0</span>. 
                </p>
              </div>

              <!-- colour indices -->
              <h4 id="color-indices">Colour indices</h4>
                <p>
                  The colour index of a star is calculated by finding the difference between the magnitudes of stars in different bands.
                  For example:
                  <div class="equation center">
                    m<sub>V</sub> - m<sub>B</sub>   =   B - V   <br><br>=   -2.5 log<sub>10</sub>F<sub>B</sub> + c<sub>B</sub> + 2.5 log<sub>10</sub>F<sub>V</sub> - c<sub>V</sub>   <br><br>=   2.5 log<sub>10</sub>
                    <div class="frac">
                      <span>F<sub>V</sub></span> <!-- numerator -->
                      <span class="symbol">/</span>
                      <span class="bottom">F<sub>B</sub></span> <!-- denominator -->
                    </div>
                    + constant
                  </div>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The colour index is often just called the colour of the star and can be used to estimate its temperature, as colour and temperature are closely linked.
                </p>

                <!-- absolute magnitudes -->
                <h4 id="absolute-magnitudes">Absolute magnitudes</h4>
                <p>
                  The magnitude equivalent of luminosity is the absolute magnitude.
                  Apparent magnitude tells us how bright something looks from our position, wheras absolute magnitude gives an intrinsic brightness of the actual source. 
                  The absolute magnitude is the magnitude that the source would look from <span class="important">10 parsecs away</span> (1 parsec is about 3.3 lightyears).
                  How can we relate the apparent and absolute magnitudes?
                </p>
                <p>
                  If we take the flux of an object and divide it through by the flux from 10 parsecs away <b><i>F<sub>10</sub></i></b>, all other terms cancel out so we get that:
                  <div class="equation center">
                    <div class="frac">
                      <span>F</span> <!-- numerator -->
                      <span class="symbol">/</span>
                      <span class="bottom">F<sub>10</sub></span> <!-- denominator -->
                    </div>
                    =
                    <div class="frac">
                      <span>d<sup>2</sup></span> <!-- numerator -->
                      <span class="symbol">/</span>
                      <span class="bottom">10<sup>2</sup></span> <!-- denominator -->
                    </div>
                  </div>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finding the magnitudes corresponding to <b><i>F</i></b> and <b><i>F<sub>10</sub></i></b> and subtracting them gives:
                  <div class="equation center">
                    m - M = 5 log<sub>10</sub>
                    <div class="frac">

                  where the quantity m - M is known as the <span class="important">distance modulus</span>. 
                  A general form of the equation can be written as:

              <!-- introduction -->
              <p><b>
                We have seen how distances are important in determining the luminosity or intrinsic brightness of objects in space, but how do we know how far away things are?
                There are several methods astronomers use to determine the distances to astronomical objects, each has its own advantages and disadvantages.
              </b></p>

              <!-- parallax -->
              <h4 id="parallax">Parallax</h4>
              <p>
                If you focus on a nearby object such as a bottle or your thumb, and close one eye then switch to the other eye and back and forth, the object appears to shift slightly.
                The difference in perception between your two eyes allows the brain to determine the distances to things.
                Notice how if you close one eye and try to lift a pen up off the table, it suddenly becomes difficult to gauge how far to move your hand to pick the pen up.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may have noticed that in the natural world, predators have <span class="important">binocular vision</span>, meaning that their eyes are at the front of the head, while herbivorous animals have eyes on the sides of their heads.
                This binocular vision allows predators to gauge distances better when hunting and chasing down prey.
                But what does this have to do with astronomy?
                Astronomers can also determine the distance to nearby (astronomically speaking) objects by using the Earth as a pair of predator eyes.
              </p>

              <!-- the earth as a pair of eyes -->

                <h4 id="the-earth-as-a-pair-of-eyes">The Earth as a pair of eyes</h4>
                <p>
                  So how do astronomers turn the Earth into a pair of eyes?
                  The key is to view the same nearby object from two different points.
                  Figure 1 shows the set up for measuring a nearby star using parallax.
                  By viewing the same star at opposite times of the year, we are essentially looking at the image with a pair of eyes which are separated by the diameter of Earth's orbit around the Sun.
                  The nearby star appears to move slightly relative to background stars which are much further away.
                  This is the same principle as looking out of a car window and watching the nearby trees move across your field of view faster than distant mountains.
                </p>

                    <b>Figure 1:</b>
                    The Earth is shown in opposite positions in its orbit around the Sun (e.g. summer and winter).
                    Viewing the target star <b><i>s</i></b> in each of these positions changes its apparent position relative to the background stars.
                    The angle made by <b><i>s</i></b>, Earth and the Sun is the parallax.
                  </figcaption>
                </figure>
                
                <p>
                  From Figure 1 we can see that the parallax is given by the formula:
                  <div class="equation center">
                    tan(p) = 
                    <div class="frac">
                      <span>Earth - Sun distance</span> <!-- numerator -->
                      <span class="symbol">/</span> <!-- dividing symbol (actually can be left empty) -->
                      <span class="bottom">distance to star</span> <!-- denominator -->
                    </div>
                  </div><br>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The position of a star due to parallax barely changes, so the small angle approximation can be used to simplify this formula, <i>p &sim; tan(p)</i>. 
                  The size of parallax angles are actually so small that the use of degrees or radians is not entirely practical.
                  Instead, astronomers commonly use divisions of degrees to measure the positions and movements of stars.
                </p>
              </div>

              <h4 id="astronomical-units" style="color: #304590;">Astronomical units</h4>
              <p>
                Objects in the sky occupy very little space - the Sun and Moon are only 0.5&deg; in diameter!
                Accurately pointing telescopes requires precisions of several fractions of degrees.
                As such, degrees are split up by astronomers in the same way that hours are.
                As there are 60 minutes in an hour, there are 60 <span class="important">minutes of arc</span> (arcminutes) in a degree.
                Similarly, just as there are 60 seconds in a minute, there are 60 <span class="important">arcseconds</span> in an arcminute.
                Using these units, astronomers can point telescopes precisely to greater than 1/3600th of a degree without worrying about many decimal places.
              </p>
              <figure class="center" style="width: 90%;">

              <p>
                Using the arcsecond, we can then define a new unit: the <span class="important">parsec</span>.
                The parsec is defined as the distance at which an object will have a parallax of 1 arcsecond.

                  <h4 style="color: #eedb00;">STAR WARS</h4>
                  <p style="color: white;">
                    In 'STAR WARS: EPISODE 4 - A NEW HOPE', Han Solo brags about the capabilities the Millenium Falcon, claiming that it did the Kessel run in "less than 12 parsecs". <br><br>
                    Now, we all know this is a brag about the ships <b>navigational</b> capabilities, not pure speed.
                    The Millenium Falcon <b>only</b> travelled 12 parsecs (which would take light around 39 years) to complete the dangerous shipping route.
                  </p>
                </div>
              <p>
                How far is this?
                The speed of light is the fastest in the Universe.
                In one second, light travels fast enough to circle the Earth 7 times.
                It takes around 8 minutes for light to reach us from the Sun, a distance of 1.5 &times; 10<sup>11</sup> km.
                The distance between the Sun and Earth is defined as an <span class="important">astronomical unit (AU)</span>. 
                The distance light travels in one year is used commonly in astronomy too - as well as pop culture, but not always correctly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Parallax is our only method capable of <span class="important">directly measuring</span> distances to objects outside of our Solar System.
                However, even the nearest objects have extremely small parallaxes - often less than 1 arcsecond.
                This is comparable to the resolution of ground based telescopes, due to the atmosphere being in the way.
                Space-based telescopes are able to take improved parallax measurements, however this method is still only possible for the <span class="important">nearest astronomical objects.</span>
              </p>
              <p>
                So how do we measure objects which are too far away for the parallax method to work?
                There are several different methods astronomers use for this, which we will see below.
              </p>

              <h4 id="the-distance-ladder">The distance ladder</h4>
              <p>
                The distance ladder is essentially a set of objects of which we know their distance from us.
                We can use these objects like buoys in the ocean, to determine how far away something is.
                We can judge the distance to something far out in the ocean by determining its distance to a buoy.
                In the ocean of space, the equivalent to a buoy is a <span class="important">standard candle</span>. 
              </p>

              <div class="astroSectionDetail center" id="standard-candles">
                <h4>Standard candles</h4>
                <p>
                  Standard candles are objects which we accuratly know the luminosity of.
                  For example, if we were to light a candle of some luminosity <b><i>L</i></b> and place it an unknown distance <b><i>d</i></b> away, then we know from previous sections that we can find the distance by measuring the flux.
                  Hence, if we place this standard candle somewhere in a park at night (being careful not to burn anything down, Figure 3), we can estimate the distance to the trees <b><i>d<sub>T</sub></i></b> near to our candle, by measuring the flux.

                  Below we will look at two standard candles wihch are commonly used in astronomy.
                </p>

              <!-- cepheid variables -->
              <h4 style="color: #304590;" id="cepheid-variables">Cepheid variables</h4>
              <p>
                Cepheid variables are very bright stars which pulsate periodically (hence 'variables').
                In 1912, Henrietta Leavitt showed that there is a close link between the luminosity and period of cepheid variables.
                One year later, Hertzsprung (of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram) measured the distances to some of these stars using parallax.
                From these studies, it was found that the luminosity of a cepheid variable could be determined from the period of its variability - and therefore so could its distance from us.
                Cepheids were later discovered in the Andromeda galaxy, revolutionising our understanding of astronomy.
              </p>

              <!-- type 1a supernovae -->
              <h4 style="color: #304590;" id="type-1a-supernovae">Type Ia supernovae</h4>
              <p>
                Parallax only lets us see the nearest stars to us (<span class="important">around 1 kpc</span>).
                Capheid variables allow us to measure distances which are much greater, thanks to their brightness (<span class="important">10 - 20 Mpc</span>).
                To measure the distance to the furthest galaaxies, we need something brighter still.
                For this, astronomers turn to the explosive ends of dying stars.
              </p>
              <p>
                Type Ia supernovae are caused when a white dwarf star in a binary system explodes.
                In these systems, the white dwarf can acrete mass from a companion star, eventually reaching a mass of 1.4 M<sub>&odot;</sub> - known as the <i>Chandrasekhar mass</i>. 
                At this point, the star becomes incresingly hot and dense until fusion in the core is kick-started in a thermonuclear reaction. 
                As no white dwarf can exceed the Chandrasekhar mass, all type Ia supernovae must be triggered at the same point. 
                It is reasonable then to assume that all type Ia supernovae have the same luminosity.
                The resulting supernova can be bright enough to outshine the rest of the stars in its galaxy - about 14 magnitudes brighter than Cepheid variables which corresponds to a visibility of 630 times further (<span class="important">10,000 Mpc</span>)!
