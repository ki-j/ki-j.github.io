                Aliens from other planets and Solar Systems visiting Earth is an extremely popular concept in science fiction, enthralling audiences across the globe.
                The Universe is old, vast and vibrant - and life formed on Earth pretty much as soon as it could.
                Surely then, life must be everywhere in our Universe.
                If so, perhaps some other civilisation our there has visited our Solar System before. 
                So why haven't we seen anyone?
                Is there anyone out there?
