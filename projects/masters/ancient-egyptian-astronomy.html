                The "Ancient Egyptians" are known for their advanced grasp of mathematics and their spectacular uses of geometry in building temples and sculptures.
                Before even the first temple was erected, in the desert basin of Nabta Playa, lies some of the earliest examples of astronomical practice.
                An ancient stone circle, nearly 5000 years older than Stonehenge, is located here, and perhaps evidence of the beginings of the first calendars to be used.
                This essay examines some of the world's first astronomers, and shows the subsequent achievements which came from the early study of the stars.
