            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The Isaac Newton Telescope (INT) is a 2.5m optical telescope located at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on the island of La Palma, in the Canary Islands.
                It is operated by the Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes (ING) and has been in operation since 1984.
                The INT is used for a wide range of astronomical research, including studies of stars, galaxies, and cosmology.
                As a support astronomer at the INT, I was responsible for assisting visiting astronomers with their observations and ensuring that the telescope and its instruments were functioning properly.
                This involved tasks such as setting up and calibrating instruments, monitoring weather conditions, and troubleshooting technical issues.
                I also provided training and support to visiting astronomers, helping them to make the most of their time at the telescope.
                Overall, my experience as a support astronomer at the INT was incredibly rewarding, allowing me to contribute to cutting-edge astronomical research while also developing my own skills and knowledge in the field.
